# Social Media User Behavior Clustering 

This project applies **Unsupervised Machine Learning (Clustering)** on a survey dataset (`HybridDataset.csv`) to identify distinct groups of social media users based on their habits and behavior.  

## Project Overview
- **Algorithm**: K-Means Clustering  
- **Techniques**: Data preprocessing, feature engineering, dimensionality reduction (PCA), model tuning (Elbow & Silhouette methods)  
- **Goal**: Segment users into meaningful groups (e.g., Heavy Users, Casual Users, Premium Subscribers) to derive actionable insights.
